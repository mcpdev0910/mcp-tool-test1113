List Issue Types Test Results
=============================

Test Date: 2025-11-13

Attempted to call list_issue_types with various organizations:

1. mcpdev0910 (personal account) - 404 Not Found
2. github - 404 Not Found  
3. microsoft - 404 Not Found
4. google - 404 Not Found
5. vercel - 404 Not Found

Conclusion:
- The list_issue_types tool requires an organization that has enabled issue types functionality
- Personal accounts (like mcpdev0910) do not support this feature
- Many large organizations may not have this feature enabled
- This appears to be a relatively new or specialized GitHub feature

Tool call was successful in terms of making the API request, but the endpoint returned 404 for all tested organizations.
